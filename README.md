# Wyoming News Clone – 2012 School Project (Raw & Unfiltered)

**Exact copy of my 2012 high school web design final project**  
A full 9-page newspaper website template cloning **WyomingNews.com** — built with raw HTML, CSS floats, SWFObject, real Flash animations, and live RSS feeds.

**This is NOT cleaned. This is NOT modernized.**  
This is exactly how I submitted it in 2012 — broken links, old scripts, missing SWFs, and all.

  <br><br>
  <sub><b>Proof it worked in 2012 — Flash animations, RSS feeds, full layout</b></sub>
</div>

<br>

## What's Inside (Pure 2012)

- 9 HTML pages (`index.html`, `page1.html` → `page8.html`)
- Raw `styles.css` with floats, fixed widths, and zero resets
- Your modified `swfobject_modified.js` (yes, the full 1000+ line version!)
- Real Flash embeds (`.swf` files missing — but code is there)
- Live RSS feeds via old RSSInclude.com scripts
- Custom JavaScript search box (Google/Yahoo/MSN toggle)
- Full-screen background + Wyoming cowboy logo
- Bonus: `resources.html`, `earth_spin.html`

## How It Looked in 2012

## How to Run Today

1. Clone it:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ethqnit/2012-Newspaper-Template.git

Open index.html in a browser
See:
Layout still works (floats!)
Menu hover effects work
Search form works
Flash boxes show "Get Flash Player" (RIP)
RSS boxes may be blank (service died years ago)


For full 2012 experience: Use Internet Explorer 8 + old Flash Player (not possible anymore)


Why This Repo Exists
Because every developer has that one cringe-but-proud old project.
This is mine.
I learned:

How to embed Flash with SWFObject
How to make a 9-page site with only notepad
That margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; centers things
That 3am + Mountain Dew = web design



Known Issues (2012 → 2025)

All .swf files missing (earth_spin.swf, smile.swf, etc.)
RSSInclude.com is dead → feeds blank
Flash blocked everywhere
Layout breaks on mobile
swfobject_modified.js is 1000+ lines for 4 Flash boxes

And that’s okay. This is a time capsule.

Me (2012): All code, layout, SWFObject edits

  Made in 2012 with Notepad, Flash CS5, and zero sleep

  Flash is dead. This project is immortal.
